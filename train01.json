In the context of this problem, the agent's goal is to stay within a safe distance of the obstacles. The safe distance is defined as the maximum of the Euclidean distance between the agent and the two obstacles. The agent's reward should be -1 if the agent is outside the safe distance of both obstacles, -0.5 if the agent is within the safe distance of one obstacle but not the other, and 0.5 if the agent is within the safe distance of both obstacles. Your task is to implement a reward function that satisfies these conditions. Use the provided code snippet as a starting point and modify it to achieve the desired reward function. import numpy as np def reward_function(state, obstacle1, obstacle2): \"\"\"\" Calculate the reward for an agent that tries to avoid two static obstacles during flight. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ","role":"assistant"}]
